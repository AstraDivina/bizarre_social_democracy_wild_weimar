= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Alliance

With new elections approaching, the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> is likely to be pushed into irrelevance by the surging <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>. In an effort to ensure his party's survival, Dingeldey has concluded an alliance with Hugenberg and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

While Dingeldey insists that the pact is purely technical and does not compromise the party’s political integrity, it proves to be the final straw for the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing. An accommodation with the anti-democratic and "socially reactionary" Hugenberg is widely seen as a betrayal of the <span style="color: #98C22C;">National Liberal</span> legacy that Stresemann and the founders of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> once championed.

Those on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing who had quietly opposed Dingeldey's turn to the right have now resigned en masse. Hans Bechly, Frank Glatzel, and Otto Thiel—prominent figures within the white-collar DHV union—have also stepped down, with Bechly being the longtime chairman of the association.

With their exodus, the party’s last remaining link to the German white-collar movement has been severed, along with a significant portion of its electoral base. The only consolation Dingeldey can claim is that the party’s loss in seats will be somewhat mitigated by its electoral connection to the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.
