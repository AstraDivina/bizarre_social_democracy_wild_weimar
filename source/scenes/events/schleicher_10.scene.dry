= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> joins the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span>

[? if dvp_votes < 4 and dvp_leader != "Glatzel": The electoral decline of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and the threat of being wiped out of parliament due to Germany's imperfect proportional system have forced the party to abandon its political independence and join Schleicher's <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span>. This decision has faced significant internal objections, as many still hope for an understanding with the bourgeois and right-wing parties to secure a place on their electoral list. ?]
[? if dvp_leader == "Glatzel": Frank Glatzel, leader of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, shares much ideological ground with Schleicher's new partyâ€”nationalism, corporatism, and the goal of a <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>. A merger with the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">German National Unity Front</span> has thus become inevitable. ?]

[? if dvp_votes < 4 and dvp_leader != "Glatzel": Nonetheless, the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and its industrial backers will bolster the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> and legitimize it among the middle class, eliminating yet another option for non-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> bourgeois voters. ?]
[? if dvp_leader == "Glatzel": Glatzel's vision of a "new nationalism" will carry a sizable following into his new political home, along with his affiliated white-collar union, the DHV, which he is bringing into the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> as well. ?]
