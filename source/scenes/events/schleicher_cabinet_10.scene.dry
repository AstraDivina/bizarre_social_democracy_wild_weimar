= The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> Enters Government

Schleicher has concluded that he needs broader popular and parliamentary support beyond the <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span>, and has opened talks with Ludwig Kaas to secure the backing of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>. Kaas has proven far more willing to cooperate with Schleicher than he ever was with Papen, and the party itself is eager to return to government.

The main obstacle, however, is the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>’s deep reservations about sharing a cabinet with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>. To overcome this, Schleicher and the <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span> have signaled their readiness to fast-track a <i>Reichskonkordat</i> with the Vatican—an offer that Kaas, a longtime advocate of such, finds difficult to refuse.

The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> claims its ministerial positions, with Adam Stegerwald securing the Labor Ministry, and other members taking the Transport and Justice portfolios. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> also brings the <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span> into the fold, which is granted the Postal Ministry.

With Ludwig Kaas’s connections in Rome, the negotiation of a <i>Reichskonkordat</i> is fast-tracked and set to be ready for signing in a few weeks.

However, their entry into government has strained our relations, as they had previously stood in united opposition with us.
