= The Death of Hindenburg

President Paul von Hindenburg has passed away at age 86. An era of history is closing, and the future remains to be seen.

The nation erupts in grief over the death of its war hero and president—though this mourning is confined largely to the political right. With Schleicher not expected to live much longer, the era of Germany's two strongmen nears its end. Now, the country must determine who will author the next chapter of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic—if it will still be called that.

New presidential elections are to be held as soon as possible. The <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> is expected to field a single candidate, and their victory would guarantee a total consolidation of power for the foreseeable future—an outcome that must be prevented at all costs. In the meantime, Supreme Court chief justice [? if judicial_reform < 4 : Erwin Bumke ?][? if judicial_reform >= 4 : Hermann Großmann ?] serves as the acting president.

- @candidates: Who are the candidates so far?

@candidates

The <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> has nominated Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord—a Reichswehr general, long-time friend of Schleicher, and the current Chief of the Army. He considers himself a servant of the state rather than of any political party, and served as Schleicher’s liaison to the trade unions in recent months. He has also been responsible for overseeing the expansion of the Reichswehr during this time. Little else is known about his ideological convictions; like Schleicher, he is flexible.

title: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span>'s last hurrah?

With Hitler gone from the political scene, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> will be fielding Hermann Göring as their candidate.

The <span style="color: #6A1E1E;">**DSU**</span> will be running [? if dsu_candidate == "Strasser": their party leader, Otto Strasser, as a separate candidate. ?][? if dsu_candidate == "Frick": Wilhelm Frick as a separate candidate. ?]

[? if nvf_candidate == dnef_candidate: The remnants of the <span style="color: #142e20;">**NVF**</span> will be backing [+ dnef_candidate +], as they remain within the <span style="color: #BFC8CC;">**DNEF**</span> umbrella. ?][? if nvf_candidate != dnef_candidate: The remnants of the <span style="color: #142e20;">**NVF**</span> will be boycotting the election entirely—continuing their deluded course of waiting for the "right moment" to spark an armed rebellion. ?]

With the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> movement remaining divided, none of their candidates have any remote chance to winning.

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalists</span> are unified in their support for [+ dnef_candidate +], joined by the various splinter factions and the minor bourgeois parties. Although Hugenberg is—somehow—still contemplating a presidential run, a strongly worded threat has convinced him to remain silent.

With the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> having been heavily suppressed during Schleicher’s tenure, they are no longer a significant political force. [? if kpd_banned: They are even banned outright, preventing them from endorsing their own candidate.

[? if z_candidate == "Adenauer": The <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> is not fully convinced to back [+ dnef_candidate +] and has chosen to run its own candidate: Konrad Adenauer. The Mayor of Cologne since the Republic's inception, and a member of the Prussian legislature, he's an advocate for the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> "leaving the tower" to broaden its appeal among Protestants, Adenauer was first proposed by Stegerwald himself. Though situated on the right wing of his party, he remains firmly committed to the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Republic and opposes Schleicher’s threats against it. ?]

This stance has put him at odds with more pro-Schleicher elements in the German middle class. While unlikely to secure significant support, Heuss has positioned himself as a "<span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span>" unity candidate in opposition to [+ dnef_candidate +]. ?][? if not heuss_run and ddp_candidate == z_candidate and z_candidate != dnef_candidate: The <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>, mired in electoral ruin, lack the resources or energy to field a candidate of their own. Instead, they have thrown their support behind [+ z_candidate +] as the bourgeois alternative to Schleicher. However, their backing is far from solid—pro-Schleicher elements remain rogue, as his message of national solidarity continues to resonate with the historically nationalist German liberal movement. ?][? if not heuss_run and ddp_candidate == dnef_candidate: The <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>, mired in electoral ruin, lack the resources or energy to field a candidate of their own. They have thrown their support behind [+ dnef_candidate +], heavily influenced by pro-Schleicher elements and propaganda that has resonated especially strongly with their rank-and-file. Many within the party now see it as their national duty to support Schleicher and his successor, believing this to be the only path toward restoring Germany’s great power status abroad and securing concessions at home. ?]

As for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, we could support a joint <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition candidate or run our own. The viability of a united front, however, depends entirely on our relations with former coalition partners—and whether they’ve fallen under Schleicher’s influence.

Otto Braun is tired. He ran and failed in the previous two presidential elections, and no longer wishes to run. His wife is ill enough that he wishes to stay by her side.  More importantly, he is deeply pessimistic about the situation we now face.

Kurt Schumacher is an ambitious rising star in the party, and would be all too willing to run. He was a hero in the Great War, but his relatively young age might be relevant.
