The vote succeeds with [+ 100 - popular_front_coalition +]% of the vote, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of a new cabinet, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

[? if not bruning_event_seen and year >= 1930: New elections haven't been called yet but it's likely that they will be soon, considering Brüning most likely doesn't have the majority of the Reichstag behind him. ?]
