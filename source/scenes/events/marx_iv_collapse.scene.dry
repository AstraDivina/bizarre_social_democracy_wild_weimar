= Right-wing Coalition Dissolved

The right-wing coalition comprising the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?], <span style="color: #A2D8E0;">**BVP**</span>, <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, led by Chancellor Wilhelm Marx, has been declared dissolved by the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] due to conflicts over school law regulations. While most coalition members supported the law, the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> expressed concerns, advocating for the primacy of interdenominational schools and seeking to limit the church's influence. 

With talks having collapsed, new elections are scheduled for May, and the government will continue in a caretaker capacity.

We suspect that Marx will step down as chairman of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] following the election. In any case, our task is to prepare for that election, where we stand to gain.

New elections have been set for May 1928.

We *could* reach out to the <span style="color: #000000ff;">Center</span> to negotiate a coalition without the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, offering to mediate their disputes with the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> over the regulation of school law, but should we, really?

The collapse of the <span style="color: #000000;">Bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">Right</span> cabinet would benefit the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, and any attempt to stabilize the government would only harm our electoral prospects.

Are we really going through with this?

Fine. We reached out to the outgoing Marx Cabinet as well as President Hindenburg, offering to mediate the dispute that had brought down the government in exchange for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>'s entry into the cabinet.

While we expected to be laughed out of the room and told to get lost, Marx actually appeared quite supportive of our initiative to salvage his chancellorship and pushed the <span style="color: #000000ff;">Center</span> to the negotiating table, bringing Stresemann and Koch-Weser along for the ride.

There is no point in forming a government that would be defunct by the end of the year.

We suspect that Marx will step down as chairman of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] following the election.

The negotiations were, quite predictably, short-lived. Any sort of compromise proved impossible as neither side was willing to budge on the issue.

Still, our attempt at mediation earned us some goodwill among the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> delegates.

In the end, it was all a waste of time as President Hindenburg made it clear he would not tolerate a glorified caretaker government including the <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democrats</span>, a sentiment hardly surprising given the President’s track record.

Quite expectedly, our attempt to form a government destined to collapse within ten months failed, wasting precious political capital that could have been spent on campaigning. The <span style="color: #A61610;">**Left**</span> is understandably upset over the entire ordeal and has begun to question the leadership’s ability to advance <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span>. A few of our core supporters have even drifted toward the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span> as a result of our failed negotiations.

Marx’s eagerness to secure <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> support for his rump cabinet has completely shattered whatever influence he still held within the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] with many now calling for his resignation. In an effort to regain the confidence of his colleagues, a party congress has been scheduled for July, following the election.

In any case, our task now is to salvage whatever we can in the hopes of maintaining our lead. For what it’s worth, the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> appears more willing to enter government with us.

New elections have been set for June 1928.
